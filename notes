//- scroll bar drag
//- mouse wheel
//- scroll on keyboard up/down keys  -- using tabindex to get the focus on container when clicked on it.
//- click anywhere on the vertical column scrolls content
//- vertical column space for scroll bar
//- prevent browser's default behaviour for keyboard up/down arrow keys and mouse wheel scroll. (using stopPropagation of event object)
//- calculate height of scroll bar for auto config.
//- nested containers with scrollbars. (required huge no. of changes - had to change the way scroll bar's markup was being generated which led to the changes in all apis)
//- top and down arrow buttons in vertical column.
/- adjust the maxScrollTop and scroll bar height when content element changes (introduced reInit api). - DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMSubtreeModified events in non IE
- using scroll bar column offsetHeight instead of container offsetHeight which lets user to have custom height for scroll bar column.
//- mouseover display block and mouseout display none feature. (need to enhance more as the scroll bar disappears even while scrolling if the mouse goes out of the container)
- showing hand cursor while dragging scroll bar.
//- avoid updateMaxScrollTop as much as possible. (got rid of it after the scrollbar markup changes)
//- get rid of getScrollUnit method. (removed after writing the adjustScrollbarPosition API which updates the scroll bar's top depending on the scrollTop and maxScrollTop)
- getting offsetTop by climbing up the offsetParent chain.
- handling the content with images as their height will be set only after the complete image gets loaded. user needs to re initialize the scroll bar api after image is loaded.
//- text selection while dragging shud scroll content
//- add class names to scroll bar, column, up and down buttons.
- write how to use page in website.
- holding mouse centre button down shud show up the scrolling arrows cursor
- customize looks (scroll bar with gradient, 3d look)
- various demo samples (use cases like online frnds/contacts box, long product description, comments box, guest users chat box, display of thumbnails)
	- modify contact list sample
	//- make the demo site look more attractive -- scroll bar to the container with all samples
	- write more complex samples with scroll bars
- horizontal scroll bar wid all features of vertical scroll bar
- various inbuilt stylish bars
- html5, jquery

- New Idea : dom element change custom event
	- poll every few secs to see if there is any diff in previous and current innerHTML or nodes.
	- let the user trigger the api to see if there is any diff in current and prev html.
